They asked, &#34;Why couldn�t we drive it out?&#34; Remember From teachbible.org
Apart from him, we can do nothing. The god�s of the pagans and all the idols do abuse men and have a low view of humanity. And suppose a strong and reliable friend promised to live with you and do whatever you. Whoever abides in me and i in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
