<p>Personally, i draw the line in a similar fashion to the banks, and consider anything 4 units an under a “small apartment building”, and anything larger more of an “apartment complex.” apartment complexes can be tens of millions of dollars or more if you�re buying huge high rises with 100s of units. For our example, i will use a 30 unit apartment building that has all 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom units with market rents of $600 per month each. However, when the rent is $755, the average number of occupied units drops to 47. A real estate office handles an apartment complex with 80 units.</p>
