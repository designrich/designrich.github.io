Rent Robert Mapplethorpe &amp; Patti Smith�s Old Apartment From apartmenttherapy.com
Sometimes, you may find the perfect apartment for you, but the lease overlaps with your current lease by 15 days, 1 month, etc. The lease for this other apartment would begin in early july. With overlapping leases, you do not have as much of a strict deadline over your head when it comes to making sure you are completely moved out of an apartment. My lease will be up at the end of september and instead of renewing it, i am looking to move out to another apartment.
