Worst Pets for Apartments From realtor.com
Although all the flats i rented over the years had no pets policies, when i asked about keeping reptiles, amphibians or fish, i was always told they were ok. Stray cats in urban areas kill approximately 449 mammals, birds, and reptiles each year. Mexican alligator lizard, frilled dragon, armadillo lizard, and the green basilisk seem like the coolest to me. Pets kept in apartments also need to be fairly easy to exercise and feed.
