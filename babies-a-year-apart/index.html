Twins Born �A Year� Apart In San Diego Mumslounge From mumslounge.com.au
A single mum has told of her shock and delight at discovering two babies she adopted a year apart are actually brother and sister. At one point in my pregnancy, i met a nurse who had three babies all under three years old. Being only about a year apart means that they are quite similar in growth stages and emotional/social needs. My babys are only going to be a year and a month and a lot of people have told me that it will be hard but it will be nice because they will go through stages of things together and they�ll be more likely to be close to each other and it�s easier to get them on a similar routine.
